# Docker Development Environment
This repository provides a Dockerized development environment for Node.js development using ```code-server```, a browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. The setup includes a Node.js runtime, essential development tools, and pre-installed VS Code extensions for a seamless development experience.

## Features
- **Node.js 22**: Pre-installed Node.js environment for backend development.  
- **code-server**: Browser-based VS Code for remote development.  
- **Pre-configured VS Code Extensions**:  
  - ESLint  
  - Prettier  
  - TypeScript  
  - NPM IntelliSense  
  - Path IntelliSense  
  - REST Client  
- **Docker Compose**: Easy setup and management of the development environment.  
- **Volume Mounting**: Local files are synced with the container for real-time development.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- **Docker Compose**: [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
`````````bash
git clone https://github.com/ReindeerGames/docker-dev.git
cd docker-dev
`````````

### Build and Run the Docker Container
Use Docker Compose to build and start the development environment:
`````````bash
docker-compose up --build
`````````
This command will:  
- Build the Docker image using the provided ```Dockerfile```.  
- Start the container with the configuration specified in ```docker-compose.yml```.

### Access code-server
Once the container is running, open your browser and navigate to:
`````````
http://localhost:8080
`````````
Log in using the default password:  
- **Password**: ```dev_password```  
You can change the password by modifying the ```config.yaml``` file before starting the container.

### Access Your Node Application
Your Node.js application will be running on:
`````````
http://localhost:3000
`````````
The application code is located in the ```my-node-backend``` directory. You can start developing immediately.

## Configuration

### code-server Configuration
The ```code-server``` configuration is located in ```config.yaml```. You can modify the following settings:  
- ```bind-addr```: The address and port to bind to (default: ```0.0.0.0:8080```).  
- ```auth```: Authentication method (default: ```password```).  
- ```password```: The password for accessing ```code-server``` (default: ```dev_password```).  
- ```cert```: Enable or disable HTTPS (default: ```false```).

### Node.js Application
The Node.js application is located in the ```my-node-backend``` directory. You can modify the application code directly, and changes will be reflected in real-time thanks to volume mounting.

### Stopping the Container
To stop the container, run:
`````````bash
docker-compose down
`````````
This will stop and remove the container while preserving your local files.

## Customizing the Environment

### Adding VS Code Extensions
To install additional VS Code extensions, modify the ```Dockerfile``` and add the following line:
`````````Dockerfile
RUN code-server --install-extension <extension-name>
`````````
Rebuild the container after making changes:
`````````bash
docker-compose up --build
`````````

### Changing the Node.js Version
To use a different Node.js version, update the ```FROM``` line in the ```Dockerfile```:
`````````Dockerfile
FROM node:<version>
`````````
